# üó≥Ô∏è Election Calculator - Model Selection

## üéØ Goal
This project explores how well we can estimate party popularity at the constituency or administrative level based on national trends and historical data.
The main objective is to experiment with different modeling approaches and evaluate their ability to approximate local voting behavior.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This project is for fun and educational purposes only.
It does not account for many real-world factors that influence election results, such as:

local candidate recognition,

campaign activity,

voter turnout variation,

sudden political events or scandals,

socio-demographic changes.

As a result, any predictions made by the model should be treated as approximate trend visualizations, not actual forecasts.
